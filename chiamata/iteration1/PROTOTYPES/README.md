During the first design sprint we developed 7 ideas and prototyped some of them.

The concept and prototypes presented are divided in 4 different categories:

1) How do I find accessible shops in my area?
2) How do I recognize the shops that are accessible with temporary ramps?
3) How do I call the shop for assistance?
4) How does the shop owner receive the call?

For each category, several prototypes/concepts have been produced:

1.a An app to discover accessible shops in the city

2.a A sticker to identify the accessible shops in town

3.a A doorbell that is easier to use and gives feedbacks to the user

3.b A beacon that advertize the presence of an accessible shop and allow the user to call for assistance with his own smartphone

3.c A custom device that understand (via bluetooth e beacon) when it is close to the shop and can be used to call for assistance

4.a A custom doorbell receiver (small and wearable) on which you can choose how to get the notification (sound/vibration, light)

4.b Receive the doorbell call on your smartphone.

in each folder you will find the material (code, graphics, cutting files) used to produce them
